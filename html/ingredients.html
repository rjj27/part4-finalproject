            <h2> Why we use certain ingredients. </h2>
        
            <h3> The most basic elements of a cookie recipe are: flour, fat, sugar, a rising agent and a binding agent. </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> In this recipe we use All Purpose Flour. Flour acts as a thickener and controls how much the cookie rises. Too little flour means that the cookie will not keep its shape, but too much means a thick and tasteless cookie. </li>
                
                <li> Butter or any type of fat adds flavor to the cookie. It also controls how chewy or crunchy the cookie is. More fat means a chewier cookie and less fat means it will be crunchier. </li>
            
                <li> Sugar obvuously acts as a sweetner, but it also helps determine the chewiness of the cookie, like the fat. More white sugar means that the cookie will be chrispier and more brown sugar means the cookie will be chewier. </li>
            
                <li> A rising agent will help the cookie rise in the oven. The most common are baking soda or baking powder. </li>

                <li> Finally, a binding agent will make sure that all the seperate ingredients hold together. The most common binding agent are eggs, but since this is an eggless recipe, we are using milk. </li>
            </ul>
