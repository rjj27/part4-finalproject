            <h2> Substitutions </h2>

            <h4> There are not many flour substitutions, but in case of an allergy to gluten, gluten free flour is recommened.  </h4>
            
            <h4> Top substitutions for butter in a recipe are: oil or margerine.</h4>
        
            <h4> Sugar is a very important component in baking and ideally, should remain in the recipe, but any sweetner could replace the sugar. The results, however, may vary. </h4>
        
            <h4> Baking soda can be replaced with baking powder. It will just result in a puffier cookie.</h4>

            <h4> The milk can be replaced with an egg. If you want to make the cookie vegan, you can use a flax egg or an egg replacement as well.  </h4>
